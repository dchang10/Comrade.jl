This is a simple convention test to confirm consistency 
between software outputs.


Properties of the dataset:
- M87 coverage
- simple structure
- no varying station gains, only thermal noise
- every station has a non-zero leakage 
- SMA has a 45 deg offset, just like EHT data
- antenna field angle information is in array.txt 


Required submission:
- File formatted exactly like the template_array.txt file 
  with the leakage terms completed for each station.
  
- leakage-corrected uvfits file self-calibrated to the final image

- full Stokes fits files with final images 
  (single file labeled as ..'full.fits', 
  or multiple files labeled as ..'I.fits' ..'Q.fits' etc.)
