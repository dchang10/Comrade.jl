# Introduction to the VLBI Imaging Problem

Very-long baseline interferometry (VLBI) is capable of taking the highest resolution images in the world, achieving angular resolutions of ~20 Î¼as. In 2019, the first ever image of a black hole was produced by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT). However, while the EHT has unprecedented resolution it is also a very sparse interferometer. As a result, the sampling in the uv or Fourier space of the image is incomplete. This makes the imaging problem uncertain. Namely, infinitely many images are possible given the data. `Comrade` is a
imaging/modeling package that aims to quantify this uncertainty using
Bayesian inference.

If we denote visibilities by `V` and the image structure/model by `I`, `Comrade` will then compute the posterior or the probability of an image given the visibility data, or in an equation

```math
p(I|V) = \frac{p(V|I)p(I)}{p(V)}.
```

Here ``p(V|I)`` is known as the likelihood and describes the probability distribution of the data given some image `I`. The prior ``p(I)`` encodes prior knowledge of the image structure. This prior includes distributions of model parameters and even the model itself. Finally, the denominator ``p(V)`` is a normalization term and is known as the marginal likelihood or evidence and can be used to assess how well particular models fit the data.

Therefore, to calculate our posterior we need to first specify the likelihood and prior. Below we provide a brief description of the likelihoods and models/priors that `Comrade` uses. However, if the user just wants to see how everything works first, they should check out the [Making an Image of a Black Hole](@ref) tutorial.

## Likelihood

Following TMS[^TMS], we note that the likelihood for a single complex visibility at baseline ``u_{ij}, v_{ij}`` is

```math 
p(V_{ij} | I) = (2\pi \sigma^2_{ij})^{-1/2}\exp\left(-\frac{| V_{ij} - g_ig_j^*\tilde{I}_{ij}(I)|^2}{2\sigma^2_{ij}}\right).
```

In this equation ``\tilde{I}`` is the Fourier transform of the image ``I``, and ``g_{i,j}`` are complex numbers known as gains. The gains arise due to atmospheric and telescope effects and corrupt the incoming signal. Therefore, if a user attempts to model the complex visibilities they must also model the complex gains. An example showing how to model gains in `Comrade` can be found in [`examples/imaging.jl`](https://github.com/ptiede/Comrade.jl/tree/main/examples) on GitHub.

Modeling the gains however can be computationally expensive, especially if our image model is simple. For instance in `Comrade` we have a wide variety of geometric models. These models tend to have a small number of parameters, and are simple to evaluate. In this instance simulataneously solving for gains is extremely expensive. As a result part of the EHT analysis[^M87P6][^SgrAP4] instead uses closure products as the data to fit. The two forms of closure products are:

  - Closure Phases,
  - Log-Closure Amplitudes.

Closure Phases ``\psi`` are constructed by selecting three baselines ``(i,j,k)`` and finding the argument of the bispectrum

```math
    \psi_{ijk} = \arg V_{ij}V_{jk}V_{ki}.
```

Similar log-closure amplitudes are found by selecting four baselines ``(i,j,k,l)`` and forming the closure amplitudes

```math
    A_{ijkl} = \frac{ |V_{ij}||V_{kl}|}{|V_{jk}||V_{li}|}.
```

Now instead of fitting closure amplitudes directly, it turns out that the statistically better behaved data quantities are the log-closure amplitudes. The benefit of fitting closure amplitudes is that they are independent of complex gains so we do not 
have include them when modeling the data. However, the downside is that they effectively put uniform improper priors on the gains[^Blackburn] meaning that we are often throwing away information about the telescope performance. The other downside is that the 
likelihoods for the closure products are not as simple. In the high-signal-to-noise-limit however they do reduce to Gaussian likelihoods. For the explicit likelihoods `Comrade` uses, we refer the reader to paper IV in the Sgr A* EHT publications[^SgrAP4].

## Prior Model

`Comrade` has included a large number of possible models (see [Comrade API](@ref) for a list). These can be broken down into two categories:

  1. Parametric or *geometric models*
  2. Non-parametric or *image models*

`Comrade`'s geometric model interface is different than other EHT modeling packages in that we don't directly provide fully formed models. Instead we provide simple geometric models which we call **primitives**. These primitive models can then be **modified** and combined to form complicated 
image structures. For more information we refer to [Model Interface](@ref).

Additionally, we include a interface to Bayesian imaging methods, where we directly fit a rasterized image to the data. These models are highly flexible and assume very little about the image structure. In that sense these methods are a good way to explore the data first, and see what kinds of image structures are consistent with observations. For an example of how to fit an image model to closure products we refer the reader to the `imaging_closures.jl` file in the GitHub [examples](https://github.com/ptiede/Comrade.jl/tree/main/examples) folder.
